 * This program computes statistics for a basketball 
 *  team using a two-dimensional array of points scored by the 
 *  players. Each row represents the points scored by 1 player 
 *  in all of the games. Each column holds the points scored by 
 *  all the players for 1 game. The program first reads the data 
 *  from a file and displays the table of points.  It then computes 
 *  and displays the team's average score per game.  Next the 
 *  program displays a 2-column table where column 1 contains the 
 *  game number and column 2 contains the total points scored in 
 *  that game. Finally the user enters a player number and that 
 *  player's average points per game is displayed.
